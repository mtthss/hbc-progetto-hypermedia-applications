The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 10:35:24 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:53:11 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:54:12 UTC +00:00]]

Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:54:43 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:55:57 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:56:30 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:58:58 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 13:59:38 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 14:00:42 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 14:01:40 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 14:02:39 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 14:04:06 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 14:04:26 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:29:55 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:30:42 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:31:28 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:32:39 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan. He constantly cooperates with very important firms in the fields of home furnishing, big and small household appliances, lighting, and of more technically advanced products as well, in addition to his collaborations in the field of sport."], ["created_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:32:40 UTC +00:00], ["image_url", "fotosadler.jpg"], ["name", "Marc Sadler"], ["top", true], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:32:40 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:33:16 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:36:17 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:42:30 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:47:59 UTC +00:00]]

He is a French citizen and at present lives in Milan. He graduated from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (Paris) in 1968, at the end of the first industrial design course (it had the well-chosen definition of esthétique industrielle), a branch of learning that was already regarded as a separated branch of learning as to architecture. Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan. He constantly cooperates with very important firms in the fields of home furnishing, big and small household appliances, lighting, and of more technically advanced products as well, in addition to his collaborations in the field of sport."], ["created_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:47:59 UTC +00:00], ["image_url", "fotosadler.jpg"], ["name", "Marc Sadler"], ["top", true], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:47:59 UTC +00:00]]

The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:49:14 UTC +00:00]]

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 15:51:26 UTC +00:00]]

He is a French citizen and at present lives in Milan. He graduated from the Ecole Nationale Supérieure des Arts Décoratifs (Paris) in 1968, at the end of the first industrial design course (it had the well-chosen definition of esthétique industrielle), a branch of learning that was already regarded as a separated branch of learning as to architecture. Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 16:03:07 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Mon, 08 Jul 2013 16:09:45 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes. The source from sports field, where research and experimentation on new materials and working technologies are more widely diffused, allowed him to export ideas and knowledge towards fields in which design (with a classical meaning) is deep-rooted for a long time.Stateless in a broad sense (he lived and practiced his job in France, United States, Asia and Italy), toady he is (probably) temporarily settled in Milan.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:04:20 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:06:07 UTC +00:00]]

This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:09:45 UTC +00:00]]

This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:24:03 UTC +00:00]]

Devoted from the start to the experimentation with plastic materials (subject of his degree thesis and of his personal curiosity) since the 70ies he brought to perfection the very first ski-boot in thermoplastic material, subsequently industrialized by the Italian firm Caber.The way was opened towards a long and fruitful collaboration with Caber (afterwards known as Lotto), that led him to the patenting of the ski-boot with symmetric shell, the most successful ski-boot for several years all over the world. This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 14:28:31 UTC +00:00]]

This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.

The sculptural base is a single sweeping form anchored by three legs - between each extension, the material curves upwards to balance the table top. The top is a tempered glass disc, measuring either 140 or 150 centimetres in diameter, and is available in an extra light finish. Three thin stainless steel plates are UV bonded to the glass and allow the base to be safely and discreetly secured using just three small screws.Early prototypes used self-skinning polyurethane foam and aluminium to determine the form the base of the table would take. However for production, the design team investigated the possible use of \"Ductal\", a self-coloured, lightweight fibre-filled concrete material previously used by the practice for building projects. Its strength and comparative lightness presented an interesting paradox and the material can be moulded to allow the wall thickness and details to be accurately controlled. Ductal is also waterproof and the mass-coloured base ensures the colour stays fresh throughout its lifespan."], ["image_url", "imagearc.jpg"], ["must_have", true], ["name", "Arc"], ["on_market_on", nil], ["product_type_id", nil], ["suggested_product_id", nil], ["tech_image_url", "tech_imagearc.jpg"], ["updated_at", Thu, 11 Jul 2013 15:47:55 UTC +00:00]]

This represented the origin of his specialization as a ?designer for sport sector, that led him to the cooperation with the most important multinational sport Companies in the United States, Asia, Japan and Europe.His professional path allowed him to mature a varied experience regarding both materials and manufacturing processes.
